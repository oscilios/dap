digital algorithm processing library

I started this repository for developping a dsp library. Things turned around and ended up working on a library for compile time graphs. You should check src/examples/crtp_synth out.
This is work in progress and experimental
The code is mostly cross-platform, however I am currently working on OSX, so don't expect this code to compile in other platforms. Mainly because of coreaudio and very few platform dependant classes.
